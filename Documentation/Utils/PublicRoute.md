# PublicRoutes Component Documentation

## Overview
The `PublicRoutes` component is a part of a React application that handles navigation based on authentication status. It uses React Router for routing purposes.

## Dependencies
- `react-router-dom`: This library provides the routing functionalities used in the component, specifically `Outlet` and `Navigate`.

## Description
`PublicRoutes` is a functional component that checks if the user is authenticated by looking for a token in the local storage. Depending on the presence and validity of the token, it either redirects the user to the home page or renders the child components.

### Key Functionalities
- **Authentication Check**: Determines if a user token exists in local storage and redirects based on its presence.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Uses the `Navigate` component for redirection if authenticated, or `Outlet` to render child components if not authenticated.

## Usage Example
```jsx
import PublicRoutes from './PublicRoutes';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <PublicRoutes>
        {/* Child components will be rendered here if not authenticated */}
      </PublicRoutes>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- **Assumptions**: Assumes that the user's authentication token is stored in local storage under the key "token".
- **Unexpected Inputs**: If the token is corrupted or not in the expected format, the component will treat the user as unauthenticated and will not redirect to the home page.
