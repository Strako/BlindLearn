# PrivateRoutes Module Documentation

## Overview
The `PrivateRoutes` module is a React component used to handle private routing in a React application. It ensures that only authenticated users can access certain routes.

## Dependencies
- `react-router-dom`: This external library provides routing capabilities in React applications.

## Description
`PrivateRoutes` is a functional component that checks if a user is authenticated by verifying the presence of a token stored in the browser's localStorage. If the token exists and is valid, it allows the user to proceed to the requested route. If the token is absent or invalid, it redirects the user to the login page.

### Key Functionalities
- **Authentication Check**: Checks if the authentication token exists in localStorage.
- **Conditional Routing**: Redirects to the appropriate route based on the authentication status.

## Usage Example
```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
import PrivateRoutes from './PrivateRoutes';
import HomePage from './HomePage';
import LoginPage from './LoginPage';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route element={<PrivateRoutes />}>
          <Route path="/home" element={<HomePage />} />
        </Route>
        <Route path="/login" element={<LoginPage />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- **Assumptions**: Assumes that the authentication token is stored in the `localStorage` under the key `"token"`.
- **Edge Cases**: If the token is not present or is empty, the user is redirected to the login page. This handles cases where the user is not logged in or the session has expired.
