# Documentation for `questionsTema4` Object

## Overview
This JavaScript code defines an object `questionsTema4` which contains a set of questions and answers related to programming concepts, specifically focusing on functions and modularity. This object is part of an educational module designed to help learners understand key programming concepts through interactive quizzes.

## Dependencies
No external libraries or dependencies are used in this code.

## Structure and Description

### Object: `questionsTema4`
- **total**: Represents the total number of questions in the quiz (Type: String).
- **id**: Unique identifier for the quiz (Type: String).
- **tittle**: Title of the quiz, focusing on "Functions and Modularity" (Type: String).
- **information**: Provides a brief description of the concepts covered in the quiz, explaining the importance of functions and modularity in programming (Type: String).
- **questions**: An array of objects where each object represents a question along with possible answers and the correct answer (Type: Array of Objects).

### Each Question Object in the `questions` Array
- **id**: Unique identifier for the question (Type: String).
- **answers_tittle**: The question text asking about a specific programming concept (Type: String).
- **answers**: An object containing possible answers labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c' (Type: Object).
  - Each key ('a', 'b', 'c') corresponds to a different answer option.
- **correctAnswer**: Specifies the correct answer option (e.g., "inciso b") (Type: String).

## Usage Example

```javascript
import questionsTema4 from './path_to_questionsTema4';

// Accessing quiz information
console.log(questionsTema4.tittle);
console.log(questionsTema4.information);

// Looping through questions to display them
questionsTema4.questions.forEach(question => {
    console.log(question.answers_tittle);
    console.log('a:', question.answers.a);
    console.log('b:', question.answers.b);
    console.log('c:', question.answers.c);
    console.log('Correct Answer:', question.correctAnswer);
});
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- It is assumed that the input data structure (object format) is consistent and correctly formatted as defined.
- The code assumes that each question object within the `questions` array will always have the properties `id`, `answers_tittle`, `answers`, and `correctAnswer` properly filled.

## Additional Notes
This code snippet is designed to be part of a larger educational platform or quiz system where users can interactively learn and test their understanding of programming concepts.
