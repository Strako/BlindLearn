# Documentation for `questionsTema5` Object

## Overview
The `questionsTema5` object is a structured data representation designed to manage and store questions related to the topic "Arreglos y Listas" (Arrays and Lists) in programming. This object is part of an educational tool or system aimed at helping learners understand fundamental data structures in programming through a quiz format.

## Dependencies
This code relies on JavaScript's standard features and does not require any external libraries.

## Structure Description
- **total**: Represents the total number of questions available in this object.
- **id**: A unique identifier for this specific set of questions.
- **title**: The title or theme of the questions set, focused on "Arreglos y Listas".
- **information**: Provides a brief description of arrays and lists, explaining their importance and usage in programming.
- **questions**: An array of objects where each object represents a single question with multiple choice answers.

### Questions Array
Each element in the `questions` array is an object structured as follows:
- **id**: A unique identifier for the question within the set.
- **answers_title**: The question text that asks about a specific aspect of arrays and lists.
- **answers**: An object containing key-value pairs where keys are option labels ('a', 'b', 'c') and values are the corresponding text options.
- **correctAnswer**: A string indicating the correct option label.

## Usage Example
```javascript
import questionsTema5 from './path/to/questionsTema5';

// Accessing the title of the question set
console.log(questionsTema5.title);

// Looping through questions to display each question and its options
questionsTema5.questions.forEach(question => {
    console.log(question.answers_title);
    console.log("a: " + question.answers.a);
    console.log("b: " + question.answers.b);
    console.log("c: " + question.answers.c);
});

// Checking the correct answer for the first question
console.log("Correct answer for the first question is: " + questionsTema5.questions[0].correctAnswer);
```

## Assumptions
- The input data structure is correctly formatted as per the given object structure.
- All questions have a unique id and correct answers are correctly labeled within the provided options.

## Edge Cases
- If an incorrect id is accessed, it will return `undefined` due to JavaScript's handling of non-existent properties in objects.
- Modifications to the `questions` array should handle updates to the `total` property to maintain consistency.
