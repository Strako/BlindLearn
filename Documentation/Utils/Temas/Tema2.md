# Documentation for `questionsTema3` Object

## Overview
The `questionsTema3` object is a structured data representation used to manage a set of questions related to control structures in JavaScript programming. This object is part of an educational tool or system designed to help learners understand the fundamental control structures like conditionals, loops, and special control structures.

## Dependencies
This code relies on JavaScript's standard features and does not require any external libraries.

## Structure and Description

### Object Properties
- `total`: A string representing the total number of questions available in this object.
- `id`: A unique identifier for this specific set of questions.
- `title`: The title of the topic covered by the questions, which is "Estructuras de Control".
- `information`: A detailed description of the topic, explaining what control structures are and their importance in programming.

### `questions`: Array of Question Objects
Each object in the `questions` array contains:
- `id`: A unique identifier for the question.
- `answers_title`: The question text asking about a specific control structure in JavaScript.
- `answers`: An object containing possible answers where each property (a, b, c) represents a choice.
- `correctAnswer`: A string indicating the correct answer to the question using the format "inciso x", where x corresponds to the correct option.

## Example Usage
```javascript
import questionsTema3 from './path/to/questionsTema3';

// Accessing the title of the topic
console.log(questionsTema3.title);

// Displaying the first question and its possible answers
console.log(questionsTema3.questions[0].answers_title);
console.log(questionsTema3.questions[0].answers);

// Checking the correct answer for the first question
console.log(questionsTema3.questions[0].correctAnswer);
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- It is assumed that the `questions` array will always contain structured objects with properties `id`, `answers_title`, `answers`, and `correctAnswer`.
- The code assumes that the input data format is consistent and correctly formatted as per the given structure.

## Additional Notes
This object can be easily expanded or modified to include more questions or different topics related to JavaScript or other programming languages. It serves as a foundational tool for quizzes or learning modules that focus on understanding and applying control structures in programming.
