# Documentation for `questionsTema6` Object

## Overview
The `questionsTema6` object is a JavaScript module designed to store questions and answers related to the topic of "Objects and Classes" in object-oriented programming (OOP). This module is intended for educational purposes, providing a structured format for quizzes or learning materials that focus on fundamental OOP concepts.

## Dependencies
This module does not require any external libraries and is written in plain JavaScript. It is exported to be used in other parts of a JavaScript application.

## Structure and Description
- **total**: Represents the total number of questions available in the module.
- **id**: A unique identifier for the set of questions, useful for referencing in larger systems or databases.
- **tittle**: The title of the topic covered by the questions, which is "Objects and Classes" in this case.
- **information**: A brief description of the topic, explaining the importance and basic concepts of objects and classes in OOP.
- **questions**: An array of objects, each containing a question and its possible answers along with the correct answer.

### Key Methods and Functionalities
- **No explicit methods are defined within this object**. However, the structure allows easy access to questions and their corresponding answers for educational tools or quizzes.

## Usage Example
```javascript
import questionsTema6 from './path_to_questionsTema6';

// Accessing the title of the topic
console.log(questionsTema6.tittle);

// Looping through the questions to display them
questionsTema6.questions.forEach(question => {
    console.log(question.answers_tittle);
    console.log('a:', question.answers.a);
    console.log('b:', question.answers.b);
    console.log('c:', question.answers.c);
});

// Checking an answer
const userAnswer = 'b'; // example user input
const questionId = 1; // example question id
const isCorrect = questionsTema6.questions[questionId - 1].correctAnswer === `inciso ${userAnswer}`;
console.log(`Answer is ${isCorrect ? 'correct' : 'incorrect'}`);
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- **Assumptions**:
  - The input data (user answers) are expected to be in the format of 'a', 'b', or 'c'.
  - It is assumed that the `questions` array contains all necessary fields (`id`, `answers_tittle`, `answers`, `correctAnswer`) correctly populated for each question.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If an invalid `id` or non-existent question is accessed, it might lead to undefined behavior or errors. It is recommended to implement error checking in the consuming code to handle such cases gracefully.

## Additional Notes
- This module can be easily extended or modified to include more questions or different topics by following the existing data structure.
- Ideal for use in educational platforms, e-learning systems, or as part of a quiz application in web development projects.
