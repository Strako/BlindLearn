# Documentation for `questionsTema1` Object

## Overview
The `questionsTema1` object is a JavaScript module designed to store and manage a collection of questions related to primitive data types in JavaScript. This module is intended for educational purposes, providing a structured format for quiz questions and answers.

## Dependencies
This module is standalone and does not require any external libraries.

## Structure and Functionality

### Object Properties
- `total`: A string representing the total number of questions available in this object.
- `id`: A unique identifier for the question set.
- `title`: A descriptive title for the questions set, focused on primitive data types in JavaScript.
- `information`: Detailed information about JavaScript primitive data types, explaining their characteristics and behaviors.

### `questions`: Array of Question Objects
Each element in the `questions` array is an object that includes:
- `id`: A unique identifier for the individual question.
- `answers_title`: The question text asking about a specific aspect of JavaScript primitives.
- `answers`: An object containing possible answers labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
- `correctAnswer`: The key (e.g., 'inciso c') indicating the correct answer from the `answers` object.

## Usage Example

```javascript
import questionsTema1 from './path/to/questionsTema1';

// Accessing information about the question set
console.log(questionsTema1.title);
console.log(questionsTema1.information);

// Looping through questions to display them
questionsTema1.questions.forEach(question => {
    console.log(question.answers_title);
    console.log("a: " + question.answers.a);
    console.log("b: " + question.answers.b);
    console.log("c: " + question.answers.c);
    console.log("Correct Answer: " + question.correctAnswer);
});
```

## Assumptions
- The input data, specifically the format of questions and answers, is assumed to be correctly structured and validated before use.
- It is assumed that the `correctAnswer` key corresponds accurately to one of the keys in the `answers` object of each question.

## Edge Cases
- If an incorrect `id` is provided for a question, the system handling this object should validate and handle such discrepancies gracefully.
- The system should handle unexpected input formats by implementing appropriate error checking before processing the data.
