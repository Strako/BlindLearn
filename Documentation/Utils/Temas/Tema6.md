# Documentation for `questionsTema7` Object

## Overview
The `questionsTema7` object is a JavaScript module designed to manage and provide information about common error handling and exception management in programming. This module is part of a larger educational system aimed at teaching JavaScript error handling techniques.

## Dependencies
This module is standalone and does not depend on external libraries.

## Structure and Description
- **total**: Represents the total number of questions available in this module.
- **id**: Unique identifier for the module.
- **tittle**: Title of the module, focused on error and exception management in programming.
- **information**: Provides a brief description of the importance of error and exception management in software development.

### Questions Array
Each element in the `questions` array is an object representing a specific question related to error and exception management in JavaScript. Each question object includes:
- **id**: A unique identifier for the question.
- **answers_tittle**: The question being asked.
- **answers**: An object containing possible answers labeled as 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
- **correctAnswer**: Indicates the correct answer using the label from the answers object.

## Usage Example
```javascript
import questionsTema7 from './path/to/questionsTema7';

// Accessing module information
console.log(questionsTema7.information);

// Getting a specific question
const questionOne = questionsTema7.questions.find(q => q.id === "1");
console.log(questionOne.answers_tittle);

// Displaying all answers for a specific question
console.log(questionOne.answers);
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- **Assumptions**: This module assumes that the user has basic knowledge of JavaScript syntax and error handling mechanisms.
- **Edge Cases**: The module does not handle scenarios where question IDs are duplicated or missing; it assumes all IDs are unique and correctly assigned.

## Additional Notes
This module is useful for educational purposes, particularly for learners looking to understand the fundamentals of error handling in JavaScript. It can be integrated into larger educational platforms or used in isolation for self-study.
