# Documentation for `questionsTema2` Object

## Overview
This JavaScript module defines a data structure named `questionsTema2` which contains a set of questions related to operators and expressions in JavaScript programming. It is intended to be used as a quiz or learning resource to understand various operators used in JavaScript.

## Dependencies
This module uses standard JavaScript features and does not depend on any external libraries.

## Structure Description

### `questionsTema2` Object
- **total**: A string representing the total number of questions in the quiz (`"10"`).
- **id**: A string identifier for the quiz (`"2"`).
- **title**: The title of the quiz, which is `"Operadores y Expresiones"`.
- **information**: A brief description of the content covered in the quiz, focusing on the importance of understanding operators and expressions in programming.
- **questions**: An array of objects, each representing a single question along with possible answers and the correct answer.

### Question Object
Each question object within the `questions` array includes:
- **id**: A unique identifier for the question.
- **answers_title**: The question text asking about a specific operator in JavaScript.
- **answers**: An object containing options labeled `a`, `b`, and `c`, each representing different operators as possible answers.
- **correctAnswer**: A string indicating the correct option (e.g., `"inciso a"`).

## Usage Example

```javascript
import questionsTema2 from './path/to/this/module';

// Accessing the quiz title
console.log(questionsTema2.title);

// Looping through questions to display them
questionsTema2.questions.forEach(question => {
    console.log(question.answers_title);
    console.log("a: " + question.answers.a);
    console.log("b: " + question.answers.b);
    console.log("c: " + question.answers.c);
});
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- It is assumed that the input data structure (`questionsTema2`) is correctly formatted and all fields are properly filled.
- The code does not handle scenarios where the `questions` array might be empty or contain invalid data types.

## Additional Notes
This module is purely data-driven and does not include any logic for handling user interactions or scoring the quiz. It is designed to be imported and utilized by other components or services that handle user input and display logic.
