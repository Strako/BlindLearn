# Speech Synthesis Module

This JavaScript module provides functionality to convert text to speech using the Web Speech API's speech synthesis capabilities. It is designed to speak messages in Spanish using a specific voice from the system's available speech synthesis voices.

## Dependencies

This module relies on the Web Speech API, which is a part of modern web browsers' capabilities.

## Functions

### speak

Converts a given text message into speech.

**Parameters:**
- `message: string`: The text message to be spoken. This should be a string.

**Functionality:**
- Sets the language of the speech synthesis to Spanish (`es`).
- Selects the eleventh voice from the list of available voices in the system.
- Sets the volume of the speech to 1 (range is from 0 to 1).
- Sets the rate of the speech to 1 (range is from 0.1 to 10).
- Sets the pitch of the speech to 0 (range is from 0 to 2).
- Assigns the provided message to the speech synthesis utterance.
- Initiates the speech synthesis process to speak the message.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
// Import the speak function
import speak from './path_to_speechSynthesisModule';

// Use the speak function to say "Hello World"
speak("Hola Mundo");
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions

- **Assumptions**: Assumes that the browser supports the Web Speech API and that there are at least 11 voices available in the speech synthesis voice list.
- **Edge Cases**: If there are fewer than 11 voices available, attempting to access `voices[10]` could lead to an error. It is recommended to check the length of the `voices` array before attempting to access an index.
