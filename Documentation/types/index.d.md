# Global Window Interface Extension for Speech Recognition

## Overview
This code snippet is designed to extend the global `Window` interface in TypeScript environments to include various speech recognition properties. This is particularly useful for supporting speech recognition features across different browsers and platforms.

## Dependencies
- TypeScript: This code uses TypeScript for type declarations.

## Class/Module Documentation
### Global Window Interface
- **Purpose**: Extends the native `Window` interface to support speech recognition properties, ensuring compatibility with multiple browser-specific implementations.
- **Role within the system**: Acts as a foundational enhancement to the browser's global `Window` object, enabling developers to utilize speech recognition features in a standardized way across different browsers.
- **Key Attributes**:
  - `SpeechRecognition`: Generic speech recognition property to support standard API.
  - `webkitSpeechRecognition`: Supports speech recognition for browsers using the WebKit engine, like Safari.
  - `mozSpeechRecognition`: Supports Firefox's implementation of speech recognition.
  - `msSpeechRecognition`: Supports Microsoft's browsers, like legacy versions of Internet Explorer and Edge.
  - `textContent`: Generic property to demonstrate extending the `Window` interface with additional custom properties.

## Usage Example
```typescript
if (window.SpeechRecognition) {
  const recognition = new window.SpeechRecognition();
  recognition.onresult = function(event) {
    console.log(event.results[0][0].transcript);
  };
  recognition.start();
} else {
  console.error("Speech Recognition API not supported.");
}
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- **Assumptions**: Assumes that the TypeScript project is configured to recognize global type modifications.
- **Behavior under unexpected inputs**: If properties such as `SpeechRecognition` are not supported by the browser, the code should handle these cases gracefully, typically by checking for the existence of the property before usage.
