# Tema1 Component Documentation

## Overview
The `Tema1` component is a React component designed for handling a quiz interaction in a web application. It utilizes speech recognition to accept voice inputs for quiz answers and provides feedback based on the correctness of the response. This component is part of a larger educational platform and interacts with various utilities for text-to-speech and quiz data management.

## Dependencies
- `react`: Used for building the component using hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`.
- `react-router-dom`: Utilized for navigation purposes upon completion of the quiz.
- Text-to-Speech utility: Imported from `../../Utils/TextToSpeech/TextToSpeech` for providing auditory feedback.
- Quiz data: Imported from `../../Utils/Temas/Tema4`, contains the questions and answers for the quiz.
- Speech Recognition: Uses the Web Speech API for converting speech to text.

## Key Functionalities
- **Speech Recognition**: Listens to user's voice inputs and evaluates them against the correct answers.
- **Navigation**: Redirects the user to the home page after completing the quiz.
- **Local Storage Management**: Tracks and updates the user's score in the local storage.

## Methods

### `voiceHandler`
- **Summary**: Initiates the speech recognition process.
- **Parameters**: None
- **Returns**: None

### `handleKeyPress`
- **Summary**: Handles key press events to trigger different actions like starting voice recognition and providing quiz information.
- **Parameters**:
  - `event`: `any` - The key event object.
- **Returns**: None

## Component Lifecycle
- **Initialization**: Sets initial state for current question and score, and adds keydown event listener.
- **Cleanup**: Removes keydown event listener on component unmount.

## Usage Example
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Tema1 from './path/to/Tema1';

ReactDOM.render(<Tema1 />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- **Assumptions**: Assumes that the quiz data is correctly formatted and available.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles cases where the speech recognition might not perfectly understand the user's input by requiring exact matches.
