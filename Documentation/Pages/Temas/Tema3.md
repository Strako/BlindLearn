# Tema1 Component Documentation

## Overview
The `Tema1` component is a React functional component designed for a quiz application. It utilizes speech recognition to accept voice responses and evaluates them against predefined correct answers. This component is part of a larger educational platform, facilitating interactive learning through quizzes.

## Dependencies
- `react`: Used for creating the functional component and managing state and effects.
- `speak`: A utility function from `../../Utils/TextToSpeech/TextToSpeech` for text-to-speech functionality.
- `tutorialQuiz` and `questionsTema1`: Imported from `../../Utils/TextToSpeech/tutorialsMessages` and `../../Utils/Temas/Tema3` respectively, these modules provide the quiz questions, answers, and other related content.
- `useNavigate`: A hook from `react-router-dom` used for navigation after the quiz is completed.

## Key Functionalities and Methods
- **Speech Recognition**: Utilizes the Web Speech API to listen to user's voice inputs and processes them to check if they match the correct answers.
- **Navigation**: Redirects the user to the home page once the quiz is completed.
- **Local Storage Management**: Tracks and updates the user's score in the local storage.

### `voiceHandler`
- **Summary**: Activates the speech recognition service.
- **Parameters**: None.
- **Return Value**: None.

### `handleKeyPress`
- **Summary**: Handles key press events to trigger different actions like starting voice recognition and providing quiz instructions.
- **Parameters**:
  - `event`: `any` - The key event object.
- **Return Value**: None.

## Component Lifecycle
- **Initialization**: Sets the initial quiz score to zero in local storage and adds an event listener for keydown events.
- **Cleanup**: Removes the keydown event listener on component unmount.
- **Updates**: On updates to `currentQuestion` or `currentScore`, checks if the quiz is completed to navigate away or speak the current score.

## Usage Example
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Tema1 from './path/to/Tema1';

ReactDOM.render(<Tema1 />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Edge Cases and Assumptions
- **Assumptions**: Assumes that the user's browser supports the SpeechRecognition API and that the user has a functioning microphone.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles cases where the user might press keys other than those configured for specific actions. In such cases, no action is triggered.
