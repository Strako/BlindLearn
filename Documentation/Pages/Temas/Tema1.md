### Tema1 Component Documentation

#### Overview
The `Tema1` component is a React functional component designed for a quiz application. It integrates speech recognition to accept voice inputs for answering quiz questions and provides visual feedback. This component is part of a larger educational platform that utilizes various utilities for enhancing user interaction and learning experience.

#### Dependencies
- `speak`: A function imported from `../../Utils/TextToSpeech/TextToSpeech` to handle text-to-speech operations.
- `useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`: React hooks used for managing state and side effects in the component.
- `useNavigate`: A hook from `react-router-dom` used for navigation between components.
- `questionsTema1`: A module containing the questions and answers for the quiz, imported from `../../Utils/Temas/Tema1`.
- Speech Recognition API: Utilizes the Web Speech API for converting speech to text.

#### Key Functionalities
- **Voice Recognition**: Listens to user's voice for answers and evaluates them against the correct answers.
- **Navigation**: Redirects the user upon completing the quiz.
- **Interactive Quiz**: Updates scores and progresses through questions based on user input.
- **Keyboard Interaction**: Handles specific key presses to trigger different functionalities like starting voice recognition and navigating through quiz information.

#### Methods

##### `voiceHandler`
- **Summary**: Starts the speech recognition service.
- **Parameters**: None.
- **Returns**: None.

##### `handleKeyPress`
- **Summary**: Handles key press events to trigger various functionalities such as starting the quiz, navigating through questions, or repeating the quiz information.
- **Parameters**:
  - `event`: `any` - The event object containing details about the key press.
- **Returns**: None.

#### Component Lifecycle
- **Initialization**: Sets initial state values and adds event listeners.
- **Cleanup**: Removes event listeners to prevent memory leaks.

#### Usage Example
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Tema1 from './path/to/Tema1';

ReactDOM.render(<Tema1 />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

#### Edge Cases and Assumptions
- **Assumptions**: Assumes that the user's browser supports the Speech Recognition API and that the user has a working microphone.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles cases where the speech recognition might not perfectly understand the user's input by allowing re-attempts through voice or key commands.

### Additional Notes
- The component uses local storage to persist the current score across different sessions or reloads.
- The text-to-speech feedback is provided in Spanish, as indicated by the speech recognition language setting (`es-MX`).
