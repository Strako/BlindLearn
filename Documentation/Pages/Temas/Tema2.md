# Tema1 Component Documentation

## Overview
The `Tema1` component is a React component designed for handling a quiz interaction in a web application. It utilizes speech recognition to accept voice responses from users and provides feedback based on the correctness of the answers. This component is part of a larger educational platform that offers various topics (Temas) for users to learn and test their knowledge.

## Dependencies
- React (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useNavigate`)
- Speech Recognition API
- Local storage for storing scores
- Custom utilities and data from `../../Utils/TextToSpeech/TextToSpeech` and `../../Utils/Temas/Tema2`

## Key Functionalities
- **Speech Recognition**: Initiates and handles voice recognition to accept user answers.
- **Quiz Navigation**: Manages the quiz state, including current question and score tracking.
- **Feedback Provision**: Provides auditory feedback on whether the user's answer was correct or incorrect.
- **Keyboard Interaction**: Allows users to interact with the quiz using specific keyboard keys to trigger actions like starting voice recognition or repeating the question.

## Methods

### `voiceHandler`
- **Summary**: Starts the speech recognition process.
- **Parameters**: None
- **Returns**: None

### `handleKeyPress`
- **Summary**: Handles key press events to trigger various functionalities like starting voice recognition, repeating the quiz information, or navigating through questions.
- **Parameters**:
  - `event`: `any` - The keyboard event.
- **Returns**: None

## Component Lifecycle
- **Initialization**: Sets the initial score to zero in local storage and adds a keydown event listener.
- **Cleanup**: Removes the keydown event listener on component unmount.
- **Updates**: Updates the current question reference and checks if the quiz is completed to navigate back to the home page.

## Usage Example
```jsx
import Tema1 from './path/to/Tema1';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Tema1 />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Assumptions and Edge Cases
- Assumes that the speech recognition API is available in the user's browser.
- Assumes that the user's browser supports local storage.
- Handles cases where the user's spoken input does not match any expected answers by providing feedback and moving to the next question.
- Assumes that input data, such as questions and answers, are properly formatted and provided by the `questionsTema1` utility.
