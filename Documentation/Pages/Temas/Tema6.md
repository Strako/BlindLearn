# Tema1 Component Documentation

## Overview
The `Tema1` component is a React component designed for a quiz application that utilizes speech recognition to accept answers. It manages quiz state, including current question and score, and handles speech recognition events to check answers against the correct ones.

## Dependencies
- React (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`)
- Speech Recognition API
- Custom utilities and data from `../../Utils`
- React Router (`useNavigate`)

## Key Functionalities
- **Speech Recognition**: Initializes and handles speech recognition for answering quiz questions.
- **Quiz Navigation**: Manages the quiz flow by updating the current question and score based on speech input.
- **Keyboard Interaction**: Allows users to interact with the quiz using specific keyboard keys to trigger various actions like starting voice recognition and navigating through quiz content.

## Component Structure
- **State Management**:
  - `currentQuestion`: Tracks the index of the current quiz question.
  - `currentScore`: Tracks the user's score.
- **Effects**:
  - Syncs `currentQuestion` with its ref for stable access in asynchronous callbacks.
  - Resets score and sets up keydown event listeners on component mount.
  - Updates quiz progress and navigates to the home page upon completion.
- **Event Handlers**:
  - `voiceHandler`: Starts the speech recognition.
  - `handleKeyPress`: Handles various quiz interactions based on key presses.

## Methods
### voiceHandler
- **Summary**: Initiates the speech recognition process.

### handleKeyPress
- **Parameters**:

- **Summary**: Handles key press actions to control quiz functionalities like starting voice recognition and navigating through quiz content.

## Usage Example
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Tema1 from './path/to/Tema1';

ReactDOM.render(<Tema1 />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Assumptions
