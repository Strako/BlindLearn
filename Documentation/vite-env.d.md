# Code Documentation

## Overview
This code file includes a TypeScript reference directive that integrates Vite client types into the project. This is essential for enabling IntelliSense and type checking for Vite-specific client features in a TypeScript environment.

## Dependencies
- **Vite**: This file assumes that the Vite build tool is used in the project setup. Vite provides optimized build tooling for modern web projects using JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.

## Purpose
The purpose of this directive is to enhance the development experience by providing developers with auto-completion, type hints, and other IntelliSense features specific to the Vite environment within their code editors. This is particularly useful in projects where TypeScript is used alongside Vite.

## Usage
Include this reference directive at the top of any TypeScript file in your Vite project to enable enhanced editor support and type checking for Vite-specific features.

```typescript
/// <reference types="vite/client" />
```

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `vite` package is installed in your project for this reference to work correctly.
- This directive should be used in projects where TypeScript and Vite are both utilized to fully leverage the capabilities of both technologies.
```
This documentation provides a clear and concise explanation of the purpose and usage of the TypeScript reference directive for Vite clients, ensuring that any developer who works with this code understands its significance and how to implement it correctly.
